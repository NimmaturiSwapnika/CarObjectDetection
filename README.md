Initially leveraging VGG-16, adjustments involved removing fully connected layers and integrating a custom bounding box head with four dense layers, utilising sigmoid activation for bounding box predictions across coloured, grayscale, and green channel images. Despite histogram equalisation, green channel images showed promise, yet overall test accuracy remained low at 20%. Shifting focus to RF for feature analysis, training with 30 feature spaces notably improved accuracy to 50%, surpassing VGG-16 performance. It's worth noting that the increase in the number of feature spaces consistently enhanced accuracy, emphasising the critical role of feature selection in maximising model effectiveness
